# Interpause's Components

My personal components library using [twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro) and [emotion-js](https://emotion.sh/). This repository uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app) however the components are reusable in any project that uses React, twin.macro and emotion-js (see <https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.examples>).
